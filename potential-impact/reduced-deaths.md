# ðŸš‘ Less Death. Less Harm. More Presence.

Every life lost in a drunk driving accident... every overdose... every 3AM fall down the stairsâ€”itâ€™s not just a statistic. Itâ€™s a nervous system that never got to rest.

Unfogged wonâ€™t prevent every tragedy. But it might prevent *yours*.

**Presence saves lives. This protocol builds presence.**
