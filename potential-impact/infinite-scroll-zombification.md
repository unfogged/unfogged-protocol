# ðŸ“± Infinite Scroll Zombification

When you're locked in infinite scroll, your brain isn't thinkingâ€”it's just surviving.  
You're not learning. You're not feeling. You're consuming dopamine instead of creating anything real.

Every swipe trains your nervous system to chase stimulation instead of meaning.  
Every feed refresh costs you a moment you couldâ€™ve spent making art, writing truth, or praying through the fog.

This isn't just distraction. It's **biological zombification**.

Around 2012, as apps were optimized for addiction, something broke in society.  
The average nervous system was already stressedâ€”and now we were handing it an infinite stream of noise.

2020 broke us. COVID was the last straw. Now weâ€™re all crawling back to the bottleâ€”of dopamine, distraction, denial.

Unfogged breaks the loop.

**Put down the phone. Pick up the pencil. You still know how.**
