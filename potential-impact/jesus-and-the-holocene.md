# ✝️ Jesus, Capitalism, and the Great Holocene Burnout

This isn’t just a nervous system fix. This is a spiritual reckoning.

Jesus came to set the captives free. But the modern world has built cages made of dopamine, stress, ambition, and numbness.

Unfogged isn’t a replacement for Christ. It’s a pathway to feel Him again.

**Walk with Him. Clear the fog. Reclaim the Earth.**
