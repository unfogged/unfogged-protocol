# 🏛️ Court-Ordered Clarity: A 90-Day Gummy Reconciliation Protocol

**What if divorce courts offered a 90-day nervous system reset before signing the final papers?**

No punishment. No meds. No judgment. Just one last invitation to heal the fog before breaking the home.

This is the Unfogged vision:

> In every divorce proceeding involving children, judges can order or *strongly recommend* a 90-day Unfogged protocol—focused on nervous system repair, supplement support, sleep, and clarity—before final decisions are made.

Why?

Because we’re not just seeing divorces.
We’re seeing decisions made through stress, dysregulation, and unresolved burnout—often with children stuck in the middle.

## 💔 Marriage Doesn't Just Collapse — It Erodes in the Fog

Most marriages aren’t destroyed by one affair or one argument.
They dissolve in slow-motion:

* Missed signals
* Numbed emotions
* Sleepless nights
* Muted affection
* Chronic stress response

And no one knows what’s real anymore. You feel distant, not because you stopped loving—but because **you stopped feeling clearly**.

## 👶 Children Are the Echo

If you divorce through the fog, the child often inherits it.

They may avoid alcohol—but still live with anxiety.
They may never touch drugs—but still burn out in college.
They carry the nervous system wounds their parents never addressed.

This protocol isn’t just for the couple.
It’s for the **lineage**.

## ✝️ Give Grace Before You Sign

We believe every couple with children deserves this one last window:

* 90 days of regulated sleep
* Gummy supplements for stress, energy, clarity
* Counseling if needed—but not required
* Faith space if desired
* Reduced alcohol and screen use

**At the end of the 90 days, if love has returned—let it.**
If peace has returned—honor it.
If clarity says it's truly time to part—then part from a place of presence, not panic.

## 🧠 The Marriage Reconciliation Stack

| Time      | Supplement                          | Purpose                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Morning   | B-Complex + Omega-3, CoQ10          | Mitochondrial + neurotransmitter repair |
| Afternoon | Ashwagandha + (Optional L-Theanine) | Cortisol reset, stress relief           |
| Evening   | Magnesium + Melatonin               | Sleep quality, emotional processing     |

This is not a pharmaceutical intervention.
It’s **biological grace.**

## 💌 We Don’t Sign Papers in the Fog

> “Do not make permanent decisions from a temporary nervous system state.”

Before divorce, try clarity.
Before custody hearings, try calm.
Before giving up on love—try lifting the veil.

This should be standard.
This could save thousands of families.
This is what Unfogged is here for.

**Let the courts consider the nervous system.
Let the children inherit peace.**
