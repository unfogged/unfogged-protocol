# ❤️ Love Comes Back When the Fog Lifts

When the fog lifts from the nervous system, feelings return. Not just dramatic ones—subtle ones. You start to feel your spouse's eyes on you. You hear their breath in the morning. The soft stuff you tuned out comes flooding back.

Most marriages don’t fail from crisis. They fade from numbness.

Unfogged helps bring people back into their own bodies—and back into each other's presence.

**The spark didn’t die. It just got buried. Now it gets to breathe again.**
