# Gut-Brain Axis: Your Second Nervous System

The microbiome directly impacts:
- Serotonin production (90% made in the gut)
- Inflammation (linked to depression)
- Brain fog, fatigue, mood regulation

Probiotics, fermented foods, and prebiotic fiber can:
- Reduce anxiety symptoms
- Improve digestion and neurotransmitter balance

> Your gut is not just digesting food—it’s digesting *life*.
