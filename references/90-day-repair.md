# The Science Behind 90-Day Nervous System Repair

Why 90 days? Because most biological systems require 8–12 weeks of consistent input to reset deeply.

- Neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, dopamine, GABA) regulate gradually
- Nutrient levels (like B12, magnesium, CoQ10) replenish slowly
- Hormonal and circadian rhythms stabilize over cycles

> Supplements don’t work like meds. They *rebuild*, not override.

### Key Benefits of 90 Days:
- Mitochondrial energy improves (esp. via CoQ10)
- Sleep architecture resets
- Stress response normalizes
