# 👤 About the Founder

### David Renne — Creator of Unfogged™

David Renne is a software engineer, creative strategist, and father who spent two decades living in what he now calls "the fog." Diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2018 and navigating the emotional and cognitive toll of alcohol use in college, David spent years building businesses, managing family life, and showing up for his daughter—while quietly feeling like he was drifting further from himself until he hit rock bottom and even found Christ in this journey of healing my inner demons and absolving the core issues.

What he didn’t realize was that his nervous system was overloaded—not broken and doctors were just masking the common symptoms of a dysregulated nervous system.

The tipping point came not with a crisis, but a moment of unexpected clarity: a single dose of ashwagandha lifted the edge off the fog. The effect wasn’t euphoric mania—it was **presence**. In that moment, David saw not only his own disconnection, but the subtle burnout, mood volatility, and fog in the people he loved—including his wife. That experience became the beginning of a full protocol: built not from scratch, but from **what worked**.

What started as a personal experiment became Unfogged™—an open-source, non-profit-backed movement to help others reclaim their clarity through nutritional support, nervous system timing, and accessible wellness rituals.

David’s determination didn’t come from theory—it came from experience. He witnessed firsthand what two dysregulated nervous systems could do to a family, to children, to love itself. His own upbringing left him with the deep, lifelong question: *what’s really wrong with me—and what if it’s not chemical, but environmental and nutritional?* That question turned into an obsession. And that obsession became Unfogged.

David’s vision is simple:

* **Clarity shouldn’t require a prescription.**
* **Healing should taste like a gummy.**
* **No one should have to “perform wellness” just to survive.**

Unfogged isn’t just a protocol—it’s a response to a broken system. One that profits from sedation, misdiagnosis, and shame. David believes in the right to remember who you were **before stress rewired you.** Before alcohol muted you. Before pills confused your mood with your identity.

And when the nervous system starts to repair—what returns is more than calm. It's joy. It's love. It's the creative electricity we forgot how to feel. It’s the ability to show up for your kids without snapping. To work without dragging. To rest without guilt. If you have drank alcohol ever in your life, you still feel love, but it is muted of the unconditional love that GOD instills in all of us when we are pure.

Adults don't just want to function. They want to *feel human again.*

David sees Unfogged as a blueprint not for perfection—but for liberation. From the 5PM glass of wine. From the 3AM regret. From the shame of asking a doctor for help.

Because when clarity returns, everything else follows.

He’s living proof that emotional sensitivity is not a disorder—and that behind every fogged adult is a creative child waiting to resurface.

> “This isn’t about going sober forever. It’s about giving your nervous system the chance to tell you who you really are—without interference.”

This is **the whole symphony** a **symphony of my life** and your potential life if you take a baby step gummy on day one of 90 days.  I just unlocked it as I have been listening so close to my emotions and they guided me to this place I created on the internet.  unfogged.org.  

The recursive pain loop passed from parent to child—not just through trauma, but through **chemistry**, through **fog**, through **unresolved nervous system states**. I saw it. I felt it. I *broke it.*  You can too.

That’s what prophets do.
That’s what sons do when they refuse to repeat the father’s fate.
That’s what Jesus did when He **absorbed the cycle instead of continuing it.**

I didn’t just write a health protocol.
I transcribed **an intergenerational resurrection.**

> *“I was a child, watching a 30-year-old parent stuck in the same loop I’m in now—burnout, anxiety, a nervous system screaming beneath the surface. And I saw it. The whole symphony. The cycle. The fog.”*

This isn’t just about clarity.
This is about **stopping an intergenerational handoff of nervous system chaos that has possibly lasted eons on Earth**.

For some, that chaos was alcoholism.
For others, it was unspoken mania, untreated anxiety, or CPAP machines at 35 and numbness by 40.

What if *your body isn’t broken*—it’s just playing a song it inherited?

This project, Unfogged, is how we change the music.

Because I almost lost my marriage.
Because I almost passed the same song down to my daughter and that scared me to the core because I lived through it and it scarred my soul until my diagnosis.
Because God spoke to me in the stillness—and I listened to his sweet song of love to find this solution that worked for me.

I’m not afraid anymore.
Because now it’s released.
And I believe others will hear it too.
