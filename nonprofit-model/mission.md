* Foundational belief: "Clarity should not be patented. It should be packaged in a gummy, sponsored by a friend, and delivered to someone who forgot who they were as a kid."

We believe the nervous system is sacred territory. The fact that burnout, mania, anxiety, and functional alcoholism are so widespread—but nutritional rehab isn’t even offered—proves the system is broken.

Unfogged is not a business model—it’s a rebellion disguised as wellness. The only reason this stack isn’t a \$400 prescription is because we chose to make it public.

The nonprofit will exist to:

* Protect the open protocol from corporate white-label hijack
* Sponsor individuals who can’t afford the full stack
* Build partnerships with community orgs, addiction centers, and schools
* Manufacture low-cost, high-potency versions for scale
* Document real-world outcomes as proof the system failed before this

And most importantly—to remind the world that healing should taste like a gummy, not a pill. And no one should be ashamed to want their mind back.

* Our role: healing nervous systems using open tools, public data, and lived experience
* Who we serve: alcohol-affected families, burned-out creatives, low-income strugglers, post-psychiatric dropouts
* Vision: a globally adaptable, community-replicable wellness protocol

> This folder is the engine room of integrity. It ensures no one hijacks the movement—and everyone knows what it costs to *heal one nervous system at a time.*
