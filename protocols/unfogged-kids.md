# 🧠 UNFOGGED KIDS

## The 30-Day Dopamine Reset for the Screen-Stuck Generation

**Doctor-formulated. Parent-approved. Kid-loved.**
A natural gummy protocol to help modern children return to baseline—calm, creative, and focused like it’s 1987 again.

---

### 🧒 WHO IT’S FOR

Children ages **6–12** growing up on:

- iPads, YouTube, TikTok
- Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite
- Hyper-edited TV and short-form content
- Emotional meltdowns after screen time
- Trouble focusing, calming down, or sleeping

---

### 🎯 WHY IT MATTERS

We’re witnessing the first full generation raised on **dopamine superstimulus**—bright screens, fast sounds, constant novelty. It’s wrecking attention spans, delaying emotional development, and zombifying the spark in our kids.

**UNFOGGED KIDS** is a simple, non-prescription daily protocol that supports the **nervous system, brain chemistry, and emotional baseline** of overstimulated children.

This isn’t about treatment. It’s about giving pure little systems the nutrients and structure they need to return to clarity.
