# 🌙 Addendum: Getting Through the Night Naturally (Especially for Parents)

Nervous system repair is messy. Especially in the early weeks, when your body is detoxing stress, alcohol, or burnout… **sleep may get worse before it gets better**.

This section is for:

- Parents trying to stay functional during recovery
- Adults already on meds (like Depakote)
- Anyone sick or inflamed (e.g. coughing, immune-triggered insomnia)
- People debating “natural” vs. “over-the-counter” sleep aids just to survive

## 🧠 Why You're Waking Up at 3AM

If your body’s rewiring itself after burnout or long-term sedation (alcohol, meds, stress cycles), you may:

- Fall asleep fine at 9PM
- Wake up wired at 2–4AM
- Feel cortisol rushes or anxiety
- Toss between needing sedation or clarity

This isn’t just “bad sleep.” It’s your **HPA axis** (hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal) **coming back online**.

## 💊 When Should I Take OTC Meds?

We don’t shame OTC usage—sometimes **you need rest to function** as a parent or worker.

But remember:

| **Natural Support**    | **OTC/Prescription Support**   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Melatonin (≤3mg)       | Benadryl (diphenhydramine)     |
| Magnesium glycinate    | ZzzQuil                        |
| L-Theanine (100–200mg) | Sleep-aids w/ antihistamines   |
| Chamomile, glycine tea | Trazodone / Seroquel (Rx only) |

**Use OTC as a bridge**, not a crutch. The goal is to retrain your nervous system to sleep _without intervention_.

## 🤧 If You’re Sick or Inflamed (Cough, Virus, etc.)

When your immune system is activated:

- **Sleep gets choppy**
- Cortisol rises to fight inflammation
- Even **Depakote or SSRIs may not override it** even though you have been sleeping well on them in the past, now that you have taken a natural step for 90 days you may feel a bit off sleep wise

---

## ✅ Bottom Line

Your **nervous system is trying to heal**, but it takes time. Until then:

- Don’t panic if you wake up early
- Don’t stack meds unless your doctor advises
- Do stay consistent with **Ashwagandha + Magnesium + L-Theanine**
- Do **pray, breathe, or journal** if your mind races at night
